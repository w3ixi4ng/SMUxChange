## 🌍 Overview

SMUxChange is an all-in-one platform designed to help SMU students seamlessly plan their international exchange programs. It integrates course mapping tools, peer insights, and curated recommendations on nearby accommodations and activities, offering a complete solution for every stage of the exchange experience.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

SMU students face several challenges when planning their international exchanges:

- **Complex Module Mapping:** The OASIS Exchange Course Mapping system is difficult to navigate and unintuitive for students seeking relevant information like GPA requirements, module mappings, or exchange destinations.
- **Uncertainty in degree requirements:** Because of the system’s complexity, students often struggle to determine which host universities and modules can actually help fulfill their SMU degree requirements. 
- **Lack of authentic peer advice:** There is limited access to real student reviews on exchange university and not much information on destination tips and accommodations. As a result, students mainly get their information via word of mouth which is inefficient.

**SMUxChange addresses these pain points by providing an intuitive, student-centered platform that streamlines the entire exchange planning process.**
